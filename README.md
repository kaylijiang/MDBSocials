## Description
This is our Pokedex application! It displays a stored database of Pokemon characters, allowing the user to search for Pokemon by their type, species, and a broad variety of statistical abilities. 

In addition, the application allows users to save their favorite Pokemon, making sure they'll always have access to their pokemon's stats. It features the ability to also search for Pokemon by tokenized strings. Entering in even only a part of the name will let the user view the file.
